        "add": "The first thing is, that you should learn code actively not passively. Learning code and watching movies or music videos are not the same. So. if you are interested to learn code in that case definitely you should learn it actively not passively. When you watch a movie or listen to music in that case you don’t need to do everything actively. You can watch that passively but when you want to learn code in that case while an instructor actually coding, you should also try to code. While an instructor tries to explain something you should try to understand what actually he wants to explain, as well as you should try to implement those tips and tricks and problem-solving things on your project. Lots of students actually watch when an instructor shares their experience but they procrastinate and they don’t do any practice. If you do the same thing, you cannot learn code effectively. So try to learn code actively not passively."

The program works fine.You are right, your comment will not execute on the program but most of the time, not one person working on a project. That means other people might need to read your code and have to understand it. So it’s important to have comments. Remember !! Good code is self-documenting and professional programming means commenting.Why comments are Crucial There are three main reasons for writing comments in your code"
